<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/02/07/introduction-to-gimp-image-editing/">Introduction to GIMP Image Editing</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 02-07-2012</span>
<p>This Thursday at 7:00PM, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Lab</a> room 266, Brian Swaney will be teaching us the basics of <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> image editing. This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html">other proprietary and expensive image editors</a>, some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary. Nonetheless, the talk shall be informative for even experienced image editors.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>Finally, the upcoming version of GIMP, and its progress will be discussed. If ready by the presentation, a new version will be demonstrated, and features will be explained. The overall progress of the new stable version will also be discussed, and some even newer features not released in the upcoming version will be demonstrated.</p>

<p>This Thursday at 7:00PM, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Lab</a> room 266, Scott Cantor will be presenting on OSU’s <a href="https://webauth.service.ohio-state.edu/%7Eshibboleth/">central web-based authentication</a> system, <a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">Shibboleth</a>. Many of Ohio State’s web-based applications and services rely on this open source project for authentication of students and employees and to obtain information about those users for personalization or limiting access to authorized users.</p>

<p>Shibboleth is primarily based on an open standard called <a href="http://saml.xml.org/">SAML</a> that allows for authentication of users from multiple organizations to services running at different organizations, a security model called “federated identity”. The key benefit to users is the ability to leverage a password or other credentials shared with a trusted site (such as OSU’s login service) to access a variety of other sites without disclosing one’s password to them.</p>

<p>Scott Cantor, the administrator of the OSU web login environment, and a developer on the Shibboleth project for about 10 years, will discuss the project, the SAML standard and federated identity in general, and their future directions. OSU’s various activities in this area will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Thursday, February 2nd at 7:00PM in Dreese 266 Daniel Thau will be presenting Unix CLI Utilities such as grep, sed and awk.  These tools are present on every Unix machine, and so if one ever finds him or herself on someone else’s Unix box without their language of choice, her or she can always fall back to these tools.  Moreover, they’re quite good at manipulating text - the fundamental necessity for managing a Unix system.  If you want to play along, bring just about any Unix or Unixy-like system with access to a terminal emulator, or if you’re on Windows look into installing “cygwin,”</p>

<p>Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Haskell.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing the series on introductory Haskell programming we will talk
about abstractions common to everyday Haskell. This will include I/O and
you should be able to wrap your head around existing code. We didn’t make
it to the abstractions last week, so this week will be somewhat abstract.
Towards the end we should hopefully get something fairly practical
discussed.</p>

<p>For those of you who couldn’t make it last week, we covered most* of the
material up to and including Chapter 8 of Learn You A
Haskell<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters</a>.
The topics in Chapter 8 will probably receive some attention again before
moving onto the other topics.</p>

<p>The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work.
If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell
Platform for your favorite operating system:
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/</p>

<p>There is also talk of doing some practical group projects. My suggestion is
going to be to work through some of the exercises in Learn You a Haskell or
Real World Haskell (free online books). If you are interested in this, we
will probably be organizing something like this during the meeting. If you
miss the meeting but would like to be involved, it will likely be a common
discussion topic in the OSC IRC channel.</p>

<p>November 10th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Maxim Kim will be giving a presentation on Clojure. Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p>

<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.  When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>

<p>This Thursday, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 266, Alex Lingo will host his infamous <em>This Week in Slashdot</em>™ discussion. As is the general format, Alex will display and discuss major events in technology, with feedback from the audience. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (often abbreviated <strong>/.</strong>) is a nerd-oriented news website where the readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the front page, with a new page typically appearing every couple of hours. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article, by posting comments. These comments are then <a href="http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml">moderated</a> by a randomly selected group of readers who can each add or subtract points from a limited number of comments for being funny/insightful/informative or offtopic/troll/flamebait, leaving only the highest rated comments immediately visible below the summary, often collectively making for a better read than the original article. Alex’s discussion will attempt to mimic this format, and provoke civilized (yeah right!) discussion and debate about news topics that matter to nerds.</p>

<p>October 27th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Regular Expressions. Regular Expressions is a system for pattern recognition in text which is extremely useful for text processing. This talk may be especially appealing to up-and-coming *nix admins, since such systems rely heavily on text for things like configuration, but should be useful for anyone interested in software. The talk will mostly use examples with the grep and sed utilities, which are almost certainly already installed on your Linux or OSX laptops if you’re bringing one along. If you’re bringing a Windows laptop, grabbing Windows versions of such utilities (or Cygwin, or Linux in a VM) may be useful if you want to play along, but shouldn’t be required to benefit from the talk.</p>

<p>October 13th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Vim, an extremely powerful text editing program. Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost. Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it. Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others. Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim. Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/09/27/making-pictures-lie/">Making Pictures Lie</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-27-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, in Dreese Lab room 266, I will demonstrating how you can make pictures lie using only open source software. Fanboys will often proclaim what they can do in a certain expensive proprietary image editor that shall not be named, so I’m going to demonstrate just the same things are do-able from another certain free, open source program. My claim is that <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is <em>just</em> as capable of making your pictures lie as any other mainstream image manipulation software.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. I also do not know the level of audience to expect, I don’t script or rehearse my presentations, and simply impressing you isn’t going to teach you anything. Therefore, the presentation shall be interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

<p>Whether you’re trying to create a <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">desktop</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wijtKqdUYsM">background</a>, <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-july-14-2008/photoshop-of-horrors">troll people</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIVJQG2XREA">remove braces</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">pass an art class</a>, <a href="http://ajitgraphics.blogspot.com/2008/09/neon-lights-tutorial-gimp.html">create</a> <a href="http://www.gimpusers.com/tutorials/hot-wallpaper-1.html">special</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY7LMnsf-7Y">effects</a>, <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/340907/july-07-2010/the-economist-photoshops-obama-s-picture">push a political agenda</a>, <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">tell a story</a> or just generally make girls feel bad about themselves to promote your brand, Gimp is more than likely suited to fit your needs.
