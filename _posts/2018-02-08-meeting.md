    - title: "How Congress’s Extension of Section 702 May Expand the NSA’s Warrantless Surveillance Authority"

      notes: |
        > Last month, Congress reauthorized Section 702, the controversial law the NSA uses to conduct some of its most invasive electronic surveillance.

        > The bill passed by Congress and signed by the president may expand the NSA’s authority in subtle but dangerous ways.

        > Section 702 is the primary legal authority that the NSA uses to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance against non-U.S. “targets” located outside the United States.

        > Under Section 702, the NSA collects billions of communications, including those belonging to innocent Americans who are not actually targeted. These communications are then placed in databases that other intelligence and law enforcement agencies can access—for purposes unrelated to national security—without a warrant or any judicial review.

        > In April 2017, we learned that the NSA’s technical and legal problems with “about” collection were even more pervasive than previously disclosed, and it had not been complying with the FISC’s already permissive limits.

        > The new law may go further than the NSA’s prior practice of collecting communications content that contained specific selectors.

        > The latest Section 702 reauthorization acknowledges backdoor searches for the first time.

        > In sum, the latest reauthorization of Section 702 is best seen as an expansion of the government’s spying powers, and not just an extension of the number of years that the government may exercise these powers.

      notes: |
        - First and only Linux-capable, multi-core, RISC-V processor

        ### What is RISC-V?
            > RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles.

            > In contrast to most ISAs, the RISC-V ISA can be freely used for any purpose, permitting anyone to design, manufacture and sell RISC-V chips and software.

            ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V))

            >  Start developing today with a HiFive Unleashed Development Board that includes:

            >   * SiFive Freedom U540 SoC
            >   * 8GB DDR4 with ECC for serious application development
            >   * Gigabit Ethernet Port
            >   * 32MB Quad SPI Flash from ISSI
            >   * MicroSD Card for removable storage
            >   * FMC Connector for future expansion with add-in cards

            > Development boards start at $999 and will ship at the end of June 2018. Early Access boards will be available March 2018.

        - EFF's founder, visionary, and ongoing inspiration, John Perry Barlow, passed away quietly in his sleep this morning.
        - Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter.
            > I knew it's also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls 'turn-key totalitarianism.'
