<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/08/24/wi-fi-hacking/">Wi-Fi Hacking</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 08-24-2012</span>
<p>I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering Wi-Fi Hacking on 2012/08/30 at 7:00pm (20120830T1900-0400 for those who love ISO8601 compliant dates) in Dreese Labs 266. What I want people to walk away from this talk with is the knowledge of how to <b>try</b> to protect their Access Points (AP) the best they can with currently available technology. I will start off with a basic introduction into simple Electricity and Magnetism (E&amp;M) and quickly move into some of the layers of the OSI Model of networking involved. The bulk of the talk will be a live demonstration of testing the security of WEP and WPA (1 and 2). I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I’m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I’m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types of security implementations that I will be demonstrating. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be a treat!</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are <b>NOT</b> responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very <b>easily</b> available on the Internet via your favourite search engine.</p>

<p>I’m asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I’ll be doing you’ll need a laptop with Linux. Also, please try to get aircrack-ng installed before the meeting, as the software will not work with any wireless card available in any laptop. So, there is a chance you may not be able to do these attacks with the given software.</p>

<p>There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/
For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=osuosc">#osuosc</a> on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 2012/09/22 – The presentation used during the talk is now available on this page. Don’t forget that in addition to files being hosted here, they are also available at my personal website, https://yanovich.net/.public/wifi/</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">SystemTap</a> is a scripting language for your kernel. It allows for profiling or otherwise analyzing a running system, both at the kernel and userspace levels. I will start my talk by reviewing some of the other profiling and debugging tools available on a Linux system, then will illustrate how SystemTap can do all of that and a whole lot more.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/06/28/irc-channel-moved-to-osuosc/">IRC Channel moved to #osuosc</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 06-28-2012</span>
<p>Our IRC channel #osu_osc has been moved over to #osuosc on freenode. The older channel is currently setup to forward people over to the newer channel. This was done for several reasons, a few of which are to make our channel name match up with the cloaks we provide (<a href="https://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml">more about how freenode operates</a>), and simplify the channel name. A few new things you may notice, besides the name, are that everyone is +v (voiced) upon joining the channel and a few new modes set. The voice is <a href="http://swhack.com/logs/2011-03-08#T18-50-27">a work around</a> for those who the IRCd may consider typing too fast or pasting anything more than a few lines. Also those with the @osuosc/* cloaks are +e and +I’ed on the room. The +e means that those with the cloaks are exempt from any bans or quiets, and the +I means that those with the cloaks can join if the room becomes +i for any reason in the future (even if temporarily). The ACL (Access Control List) remains the same from the previous room, /msg ChanServ access #osuosc list. For an explanation of all the channel modes set at any give time you can pull up help in two places: <strong>/quote help cmode</strong> or <a href="https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml">freenode’s guide to “Using the network”</a>. (Note the /quote command also works for user modes too, <strong>/quote help umode</strong>.) Also at this time the channel #osuosc-ops was created for those who have privileges on #osuosc to handle any type of dispute that may arise in the future from a ban. This channel will primarily be for handling any type of disputes that may arise from a ban or any other channel management. This channel is logged for internal use of the ops. The rules for the channel remain the same as previously set and remember the channel is still logged.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/05/21/bedrock-linux/">Bedrock Linux</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-21-2012</span>
<p>Thursday, May 24th at 7:00PM in Dreese 369, Daniel Thau will be presenting Bedrock Linux.  Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently.  For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/05/11/elections-latex-and-lan-party/">Elections, LaTeX, and LAN party</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-11-2012</span>
<p>Elections for the OSU Open Source Club officer positions are currently planned for May 17th, 2012. They will take place in the normal meeting room (Dreese 369) and at the normal time (7:00PM EDT). If the date does not work for you and you are a voting club member (ie, you are a student and have attended at least one meeting prior to the vote), please contact the club offers as soon as possible and we will see what we can do. Three positions need to be filled. More details about the responsibilities of each member can be found in the <a href="/constitution">club constitution</a> on our web page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>President: Primary responsibility is to ensure a meeting place and topic is set.</li>
  <li>Vice President: Keep the minutes and fill in for the President when he or she is unavailable.</li>
  <li>Treasurer: Manage club funds (and order pizza)</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically the club has had other positions (which are not officially recognized by the university):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Webmaster: manages the club website.</li>
  <li>E-council representative: Attends e-council meetings. Usually appointed by the Treasurer.</li>
</ul>

<p>As is evident from the tone of our club constitution, the club’s original founders seemed to intend for it to be reasonable laid back; none of these positions should be overly stressful. Worst case scenario is the club website has some downtime, the club misses some free pizza, we have to fumble to find a new room, and have to wing a conversation rather than having a pre-set presentation. In addition to the election, Daniel “paradigm” Thau will present the LaTeX markup language. LaTeX is a markup language used by many Mathematicians, Scientists, and Engineers which is particularly capable at typesetting Mathematics. Finally, a reminder: Mothers day is Sunday, May 13th. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas for what to get her, maybe the Open Source Club LAN party the day before on Saturday, May 12th which runs from 2:00PM to 11:30PM (ie, 9.5 hours) at the Ohio Union Interfaith Prayer and Reflection room would be a good place to find something. Maybe. Okay, probably not.</p>

<p>This Thursday, will be a presentation on Python. This presentation will cover many of the basics and bring people up to speed of creating applications in the language. The crash course into Python’s basics will be “follow along” and questions are encouraged. The later half of the presentation will be presenting clever and nifty ways to accomplish various tasks that can be done in Python that are easier than building in other languages. A tour of the standard library is expected along with a tour of some open source Python projects that can be implemented into anything you may want to create.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 26th at 7PM in Caldwell 369, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

For a lab in his Python class, he built a simple Bayes network-based text classifier to identify That’s What She Said jokes in conversation transcripts. This will be added to Jenni, the Open Source Club’s IRC bot, so that she can make jokes at appropriate times in conversation. It will replace the old TWSS identifier.</p>
