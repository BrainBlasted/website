<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2014/09/08/wireless-security/">Wireless Security</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-08-2014</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2014/09/11 at 7pm, in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace will present Wireless Security. In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine.</p>

<p>I reiterate, <b>DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</b></p>

<p>In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/
For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 24th 2014 in Caldwell Labs 120, C. Matthew Curtin will present “Cracking the Data Encryption Standard.”</p>

<p>Matt was one of the leaders of the DESCHALL project that cracked a message encrypted with the then-US-Government-Standard 56-bit DES using idle cycles of computers connected over the Internet. His book, Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption Standard, is the memoir of that project, and the presentation will give an inside look into one of the largest computations ever performed, forcing a change in US policy, and looking back and seeing how what happened then relates to the present policy issues regarding the relationship between the government and its citizenry online.</p>

<p>This will be our last official meeting of the 2013-2014 academic year, so we will do a goodbye to seniors.</p>

<p>As always, there will be pizza. Expect it to be a little nicer than usual.</p>

<p>Thursday, 2014/04/17 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Owen King of the Department of Philosophy will present: Anti-features, Free and Open Source Software, and Ethics.</p>

<p>Abstract:
DRM, spyware, adware, crippleware, backdoors.  What do all these have in common?  For starters, we usually prefer that they not be included in our software.  More specifically, we can say that these are all examples of anti-features.  Unfortunately, most ways people have tried to define ‘anti-feature’ have been inadequate in some way.  My first task, then, is to develop a clear, careful definition of an anti-feature. Next, I turn to the question of whether free and open-source software (FOSS) is compatible with anti-features.  The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a qualified yes.  My third task is to explain why anti-features exist in the first place, and why it is usually a bad thing. In fact, it is often immoral for a programmer to implement an anti-feature.  Finally, I explain why FOSS can be a user’s best defense against anti-features.</p>

<p>As always, there will be pizza.</p>

<p>This Thursday, May 27th at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs (CL) 120, Daniel Thau and Brad Hollander will present Bedrock Linux.   Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution founded by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently. For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.</p>
