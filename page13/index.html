<p>On Thursday October 15th, 2009, Scott Merrill from Columbus FreeGeek presented on how to get involved in the tech scene here in Columbus. FreeGeek Columbus provides computers and training for limited-resource populations in Central Ohio through redistribution of used equipment and the use of Free Software. FreeGeek Columbus is committed to Free Software, responsible electronics recycling, and community engagement. In his presentation, Scott gave us a brief overview of who FreeGeek is and what they do, touch upon the hazards of electronic waste, describe how FreeGeek rewards volunteers, and share how they’re advocating Ubuntu Linux to people. After his presentation Scott answered everyone’s questions! As always, there will be pizza! <strong>Update:</strong>At the end of this meeting, we voted on finalizing some constitutional amendments from <a href="/node/88">last year</a>.

<p>This Thursday at 7pm in Dreese Labs 266, Alex Lingo, a former President and Vice President of the club, will be presenting on the much misunderstood topic of LVM. The Logical Volume Manager is a system in the Linux kernel that allows the abstraction of physical data volumes into so called “logical volumes”. For example, with LVM, 3 1TB disks can be combined into a single 3TB linear volume. Alex is going to give a brief overview of how the system works, as well as give a demonstration first hand to show the ins and outs of the system. I hope to see you all there!</p>

<p>This week Alek will be giving an introduction to Linux and an overview a good chunk of the Linux distributions that one has to choose from. We will go over all the pros, cons, features, strengths, setup nuances, requirements, and finally how to pick the perfect distro for your needs. After the overview we will then run through a graphical install of Ubuntu and then a text based install of Debian in order to both show the differences between the distributions and how text and graphical installs differ. Our meeting will be on Thursday October 1st in Dreese Labs room 266 and, as always, the meeting is open to everyone. We especially welcome newcomers to this meeting so we can introduce you to the world of Linux and how to get started! Bring any questions you have and we will be happy to answer. Attached below are the presentation slides from this meeting. There is both an OpenDocument format and a Microsoft Powerpoint format. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Tonight (Thursday, 2/5 ) we will be doing the impossible and making more forward progress on a club project. There will also be some people from the design college coming to talk about projects they need help with, so while they are there we will milk some ideas for an interface from them.</p>

<p>For those who missed our last project meeting, here a quick recap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will be working on making a desktop widget.</li>
  <li>There were quite a few good ideas thrown out, and we now need to settle on one.</li>
  <li>We will start small so that less experienced people have a chance to learn about what we are doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We might be able to look through the source code from a widget today if I can find one that is simple enough.</p>

<p>The meeting will be at 7p in 266 Dreese.</p>
